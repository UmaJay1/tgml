No same-sex twins that both presented with GD were identified during the study period. The proportion of different-sex twins both presenting with GD (37%) was higher than that in same-sex twins (0%, Fisher's exact test p-value < 0.001) and in non-twin sibling pairs (0.16%). The present findings suggest that familial factors, mainly confined to shared environmental influences during the intrauterine period, seem to contribute to the development of GD.
